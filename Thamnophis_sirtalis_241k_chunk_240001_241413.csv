Caught a baby garter snake, under 6"" in length, consuming a just-emerged Northern Pacific Tree Frog.  The frog was not as wide as my small fingernail, and not as long as my trimmed thumbnail.

It was heart-wrenching for me to watch this... as a amphibian, and especially a frog lover, but it is nature.
